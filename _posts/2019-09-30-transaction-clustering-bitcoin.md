For the significant portion of 2018, as part of my PhD studies at the University of Luxembourg, I've been working on network-level privacy attack on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with professor Alex Biryukov.
This blog post summarizes our findings, which have been published in 2019 ("[Deanonymization and linkability of cryptocurrency transactions based on network analysis](http://hdl.handle.net/10993/39724)").

You though it was enough to use mixers or privacy-focused altcoins to preserve the privacy of your cryptocurrency transactions?
Think again...


# Privacy in cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin was the first successful implementation of decentralized digital money.
Its key innovation is using proof-of-work to make modifying the ledger difficult.
But in order to be really decentralized, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies must provide at least some level of privacy.
Otherwise, those in power would still have some degree of influence over cryptocurrency users.

Contrary to your bank account, generating a Bitcoin address doesn't require you have a passport.
You can, and are in fact advised to, generate a new address for every transaction.
This doesn't guarantee full privacy though.

The fundamental trade-off here is between privacy and verifiability.
Bitcoin tries to be decentralized: users must be able to independently validate incoming transactions.
But to be able to _verify_ incoming bitcoins, I must know _where they are coming from_.

Bitcoin transactions, once included in a block, are stored on thousands of nodes worldwide.
Anyone can download the whole Bitcoin transaction history and analyze it.
Turns out, there are techniques to extract quite a bit of information from the blockchain.

A Bitcoin transaction _consumes_ (spends) a number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and creates new UTXOs.
One heuristic is that all UTXOs in a transaction belong to the same entity.
This is not generally true due to multisigs etc, but good enough for a heuristic.
Another heuristic is that one of the outputs is the _change_ address.
Just as with cash, it usually happens that you don't pay the exact amount, but pay a bit extra and receive change back.
Multiple papers have been published along those ideas, and there are commercial companies which offer services of deanonymizing cryptocurrency users.

Multiple alternative cryptocurrencies aim at stronger privacy, most popular ones being Dash, Monero, and Zcash.
They do indeed prevent or at least hinder blockchain analysis.
While Dash mixing technique is arguably not very strong, and flaws have been found in Monero and in Zcash as well, but in general one cannot simply go to a blockchain explorer and look where the particular coins come from.

The information stored on the blockchain is stored there forever.
But what about the ephemeral information in the peer-to-peer network?
Can an attacker extract any useful deanonymizing data from observing the network traffic?
What makes the idea even more interesting is that privacy focused cryptocurrencies use P2P networks similar to Bitcoin...


# Randomization of transaction propagation

Cryptocurrencies rely on peer-to-peer network to propagate data.
A Bitcoin node connects to 8 random nodes (and may accept incoming connections) and relays transactions to them.
They, in turn, relay it to their neighbors, and so on.
After a few seconds, nearly all nodes become aware of the new transaction, and miners can include it in a block.

If Alice knows a new transaction, she first announces its hash in an inventory (INV) message to Bob.
Then only if Bob is interested in this transaction he replies with GETDATA message, and Alice replies with a TX message for a transaction or a BLOCK message for a block.
If this gossiping mechanism was implemented just naively, it would be dangerous for privacy, because an adversary can listen to the network and try to estimate the "rumor source".
That's why there are certain _broadcast randomization_ techniques used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: trickling and diffusion.

Trickling was used in Bitcoin before 2015 and is still used in Zcash.
In trickling, instead of announcing a new transaction to all the neighbors, a node chooses a random subset of the neighbors and announces the transaction to them.
Then after a certain time, another random subset is chosen, and the transaction is announced to it.
In diffusion, for each neighbor, a node announces the transaction to each neighbor after a random delay.
As we will show, these methods to make network analysis more difficult are not completely successful.



# Transaction clustering based on network-level information

The general idea behind our attack is to connect to many nodes and log the timestamps of transaction announcements.
The intuition is that transactions which originate from the same node propagate in a _similar_ fashion.
(We will define the notion of similarity later.)
First, we have to overcome some technical difficulties to collect the data.


## Parallel connections

As described earlier, Bitcoin uses mechanism known as diffusion to make network-level attacks on privacy difficult.
If we collect data by only connecting to each node once, as the reference software allows us to do, we won't gain much.
Ideally, we want to be the first to receive a new transaction announcement from the peer which generated it.

Consider a typical full node which accepts incoming connections.
By default, it maintains 8 outgoing and allows up to 117 incoming connections.
Say, it has 12 incoming connections, for a total of 20 connections.
This means that due to diffusion, we have only a 1 in 20 chance of being the first to hear about a new transaction.

To overcome broadcast randomization, we use an alternative implementation of the Bitcoin networking stack called [bcclient](https://github.com/ivanpustogarov/bcclient).
It was developed here at [CryptoLUX](https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Home) as part of the research resulting in "[Bitcoin over Tor isnâ€™t a good Idea](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6079)" and "[Deanonymisation of Clients in Bitcoin P2P Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7418)".
Bcclient connects to Bitcoin nodes with multiple _parallel_ connections.
As Zcash inherited most of networking properties of Bitcoin, it was relatively straightforward to adapt bcclient for Zcash.


## Weighting IP addresses

Next, we want to find a metric to compare transactions.
Each transaction can be characterized by a vector of IP addresses which announced it to us.
To the best of our knowledge, previous work on network-level privacy only considered the first IP to announce a transaction.
We consider a _vector_ of IP addresses to each transaction, and assign _weights_ to them.

Intuitively, the first IP to announce the transaction to us is the most likely to be the sender.
For each subsequent IP, the probability of it being "close" to the sender decreases.
In real network some transactions get to us very quickly, some of them get to us a little bit slower.
For every transaction, we want the weight of IP addresses to drop neither too quickly nor too slowly.
Here is an example of weights assigned to three (made up) timestamp vectors by our parameterized weight function (see the paper for details):

## Calculating correlations

Next, we create a correlation matrix.
For each pair of these weight vectors we calculate the correlation coefficient and we put these coefficients into a matrix.
Our hypothesis is that this matrix would have a special structure: with the right permutation of rows and columns, clusters would be visible along the main diagonal.
That would mean that some subsets of transactions are closer related to each other than to other transactions.

And the next point is how do we measure the effect of our attack, how do we measure the anonymity.
We use the [anonymity degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_anonymity) proposed by Diaz et al in 2002.
The anonymity degree was introduced for messaging systems.
It measures the amount of information that the attacker can get regarding who was the author of each message.
The anonymity degree varies from 0 to 1, where one is perfect anonymity, and zero means no anonymity at all.


## Recap: what we do step by step

We connect to many nodes from servers on three continents (Europe, Asia, and North America) to get a better view of the network.
We log transaction announcements and assign weights to vectors of timestamps for each IP address.
Then we calculate the pairwise correlations between these weight vectors and apply the spectral co-clustering algorithm, which tries to find the permutation of rows and columns in the matrix such that the internal clustering structure would be visible.
It is [implemented](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/biclustering.html#biclustering) in a popular Python sklearn library.
Then we calculate the anonymity degree using our own transactions as ground truth.


# Results

The paper gives more detailed information about the results, but this is the picture were were able to achieve the following picture on the Bitcoin testnet:

<img src="../images/posts/2019-09-30-transaction-clustering-bitcoin-testnet.png" width="800" alt="Result for Bitcoin testnet"/>

On the Bitcoin testnet we did the full-scale experiment connecting to all nodes with as many connections as possible.
We clearly see that our own transactions (marked with black lines) form a cluster, and we see some other clusters forming along the main diagonal.
We also did the experiment on the Bitcoin mainnet, but in order not to disrupt the real network, will limited ourselves to only connecting to 1,000 nodes, which is about 1/10 of the nodes available, and didn't try to occupy all connection slots.
The results on mainnet are significantly worse: our transactions are scattered around the clusters.

We also did an experiment on Zcash, and there the picture is not that clear, but still our transactions form a cluster.
It's also important to note that in Zcash transactions can be shielded or transparent, and all the shielded transactions take advantage of sophisticated cryptography of zk-SNARKs.
Hear the longer black lines indicate the shielded transactions, and shorter indicate transparent transactions, which shows that our method doesn't care whether you use zk-SNARKs or not because we only take hashes into account.
Zcash shows a similar pattern:

<img src="../images/posts/2019-09-30-transaction-clustering-zcash-mainnet.png" width="800" alt="Result for Zcash mainnet"/>

On Dash and Monero, we did do the full experiments with our own transactions, but we discovered that their traffic structure also exhibits some cluster properties (see the paper for the full results).

We also tried to estimate the original IP address for the cluster.
It is only possible in certain circumstances: when a node connects to a network, it advertises its IP address in an ADDR message.
If our listener nodes are online and are recording this traffic, they can compare the IP address announcement in the address message with the IP addresses which are highly ranked in certain clusters.
We show that, at least for the Bitcoin testnet, an adversary can narrow down the search of the source IP address to about five IP addresses.

What about countermeasures?
From a cryptocurrency user's point of view, you shouldn't issue many transactions during the same session.
If you do, you may want to run your nodes with an increased number of connections and also periodically drop and re-establish connections.

I should also mention two recent developers in Bitcoin: Dandelion / [Dandelion++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11060) and [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), which would defeat our attack if implemented.


# Conclusion

Many blockchain developers think of the network layer as a black box: it broadcasts transactions, what else do we need?
Turns out, timing of transaction announcements actually reveals information on related transactions, which is invisible on the application level.
Randomization techniques, as they exist today, are not 100% efficient.
This is especially crucial for privacy focused cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash.
