CHANGE PUBLICHED TO FALSE TO PUSH AS DRAFT

why we are here? 1. cool tech, 2. career perspectives (not = big money, but at least being relevant in 10-20 years). 
two scenarios for Bitcoin (and permissionless blockchains): "to the moon" (global payment system, business via smart contracts, BTC $100k) or catastrophic failure ("this software is experimental", v0.18, mentioned not to sound irrationally optimistic IMO). third option: everything works but no one cares.
our origins: cypherpunks. "we have cryptography, can overcome government censorship!" true? yes, kinda (modulo bugs in PGP clients, which have no maintainers). but who cares? vast, vast majority of people just use Facebook, a small minority uses Signal / Telegram (more of a virtue signaling? requires phone number, which is kinda non-starter). turns out: to use X to communicate, you have to convince counter-party to use same system, usability > sovereignty. For your field to be relevant, enough people must care.
a series of blog posts on Bittorrent history: "if you're not breaking the rules, you're doing it wrong". Bittorrent broke rules around copyright. why wasn't stopped? 1. sufficiently decentralized; 2. hundreds of millions cared enough to make prosecution politically difficult. Bitcoin breaks rules around money. is decentralized, but do enough people care? developed world has banks with apps, 99.9% never face censorship. developing? "leap-frog banking?" centralized M-pesa.
underestimated scenario: Bitcoin works, few care, but guarantees competitive pressure on banks. If can make LN tx in seconds to whoever, con they sell me "banking holidays", "opening times"? maybe on 10 years just have centralized digital payments "good enough" for most people, like Bittorrent -> Spotify?
even so! blockchain research requires understanding multiple fields, from deep tech to economics / game theory. skills hopefully needed in many fields (if general AI isn't invented - then we're all screwed).
