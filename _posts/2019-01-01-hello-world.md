title: Hello, world!

Hi, I'm Sergei. I'm doing blockchain security research in the University of Luxembourg. Read more on the [About](/about) page.

The first day of the year is a nice moment to start something. I've been planning to create a personal blog for quite some time now, so here it is. I'm going to write about my research, the things I read (see my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86128188-sergei-tikhomirov)), the events I take part in (conferences, hackathons, etc), and share my thoughts on blockchain-related topics, personal development, and more.

Subscribe to the blog via [RSS](/feed.xml) and feel free to say hi in the comments or on any social media (see footer).

Happy New year!
